# LambdaEssentials
This plugin is designed to be a small and lightweight alternative to some other plugins like this.  

Very easy to use, just drag the file into the plugins folder and start the server.

*This Plugin is made for 1.16.5, if you get any errors on another version then I won't take a look at it.*
